# Privacy Policy
## What information is stored?
The bot will **never** ask for or require any personal information relating to any user. In a sqlite database, it stores: 

* Discord-generated IDs (Guild, User, Channel, Message, Interaction) that are available to any user with developer mode enabled
* User-entered information regarding server-related content, with the expectation that this information is written for fictional purposes

## Who can see this information?
Data associated with any specific server can only be retrieved within that same server by moderator-specified members.

## How can I remove data?
If the bot is removed from your server, all data related to that server's ID will be removed by the developer via a periodic database sweep. Due to the nature of certain discord outages, this information is not removed automatically upon bot removal. Most user-entered data can be removed via dedicated bot commands.

## Questions and Concerns
All questions are fielded in the [support server](https://discord.gg/VZYKBptWFJ) or via discord direct message (@Firefly#7113)
