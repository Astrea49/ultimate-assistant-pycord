# Getting Started
1. With discord's permissions v2 update, server administrators can now decide which roles can use specific command groups. To prevent abuse from non-players, it is highly recommended to enable the player-centric groups for your player role. By default, all admin groups are set to admin-only, but can be enabled for other roles as moderaters see fit.

Player groups are: 
/currency
/gacha
/help
/inv
/investigate
/msg
/profile
/roll

2. Each player and character in your game will need to be registered with `/profile_admin new`. Players can have multiple registered characters each, but only one active character at a time.

3. It is recommended to give each player their own channel to receive messages generated by `/msg whisper` and `/msg anon`. Do this with `/profile_admin edit channel`.
