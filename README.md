# Dependencies
Built and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (WSL) with 
- python 3.8.10
- py-cord 2.0.0b5
- aiocron 1.8
- d20 1.1.2

Linted with pylint 2.13.5


# Setting up your server
1. Admin commands will not work for non-admins, but will not be greyed out by default. To grey out commands for non-players and admins, moderators should consider using the Integration settings in your server settings like so:
![ex 1](./images/perms_example1.PNG)
![ex 2](./images/perms_example2.PNG)
![ex 3](./images/perms_example3.PNG)

2. Each player and character in your game will need to be registered with `/profile_admin new`. Players can have multiple registered characters each, but only one active character at a time.

3. It is recommended to give each player their own channel to receive messages generated by `/msg whisper` and `/msg anon`. Do this with `/profile_admin edit channel`.


# Hosting
1. Set up python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html)
2. Start your virtual environment with `source /path/to/venv`.
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. In the top directory, create a file called `TOKEN.txt` and paste your bots token as a single line.
5. Paste bot token in a new file named `TOKEN.txt`
6. Add any testing servers to `config.py`. Commands can take up to an hour to register to other servers.
7. Run with `python main.py`
