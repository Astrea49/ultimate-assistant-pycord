It aims to provide simple yet versatile utilities for discord-hosted rpgs ranging from asynchronous thread-style games to traditional sitdown tabletops. The bot includes a highly customizable profile system, automated/scheduled posting, flexible dice commands, inventories, and investigatable objects.

# Getting Started
1. With discord's permissions v2 update, admin permissions are now in the hands of server moderators. To grey out commands for non-players and non-admins, moderators should *heavily* consider using the Integration settings in their server settings like so:

![ex 2](./images/perms_example2.PNG)
![ex 3](./images/perms_example3.PNG)

2. Each player and character in your game will need to be registered with `/profile_admin new`. Players can have multiple registered characters each, but only one active character at a time.

3. It is recommended to give each player their own channel to receive messages generated by `/msg whisper` and `/msg anon`. Do this with `/profile_admin edit channel`.
